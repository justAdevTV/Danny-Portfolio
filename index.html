                                As a student of Pierce College, I have found incredible value in being engaged on campus beyond academics. In Fall semester of 2017, I decided to join my campuses vibrant political community. Throughout the course of the semester I was able to help design a comprehensive media profile for one of the political clubs on campus. I was also able to engage in my campuses political dialogue during the Day of Politics event. Here is some of the my  extracurricular work.

                        JOTS Another contribution I made to Hastings’ media profile was a posts on DRS’s JOTS blog. I am an avid reader, so one day I happened to stumble upon Hastings in American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. Upon revealing this to my mentor, I decided to create a blog post on the luxury retailers inclusion within the novel. The post was published on April 10, 2017.

                        YAL Intro Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) is a national collegiate association advocating for Constitutional freedoms. The club provided me a lane to express my unique political beliefs while at the same time giving me a platform to develop my branding techniques. My work as the clubs media coordinator aided the club in becoming YAL’s largest chapter on the west coast.

                        Design As the clubs media coordinator, I was tasked with designing a flyer for the club. In early September of 2017, I designed this piece around a few key design techniques. I used the an iconic image (the Statue of Liberty) to equate our clubs values with the American Dream. The color yellow represents the ideas of the Libertarian Party, who also uses the color for their campaigns. Then I expressly wrote the the clubs beliefs and the time of our meetings in a clear and concise format. These different techniques came to create a progressive first impression on potential club members.

                        Newspaper Column Alongside the publication of the flyer, I published a column in my school's newspaper advocating for the removal of our campus “Free Speech Zones”. This column, alongside the flyer allowed our club to dominate our campuses media and physical environment.

                        Outcome After the publication of both projects, I lead a group of club members to post the flyers around campus. With a comprehensive media presence at our school, we were able to recruit nearly 30 members in our first month as a club. Both projects were a big hit and contributed to a large showing at our first club meeting.

                        Day of Politics On October 19, 2017, Pierce College hosts the annual “Day of Politics”. The day is comprised of student debate as well as presentations by legislators. As a member of the political community at my school, I elected myself to debate during the event. (Left: California State Senator, Henry Stern)

                        Debate The topic of debate was health care. In front of a crowded auditorium, I argued that government entanglement has caused healthcare prices to skyrocket. Although an unpopular opinion, I was elected as winner of the debate through my use of primary sources and audience participation.

                        Outcome The event was not only successful for the club, but for myself personally. Our club had the opportunity to meet prominent legislators in the Los Angeles community (in this photo: former Green Party Mayor of Santa Monica, Michael Feinstein). I was able to refine my public speaking skills and engage in meaningful political dialogue. Our club ended the Day of Politics having recruited more members and solidify our prominence in the Pierce College political community.
